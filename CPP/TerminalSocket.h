/**
 * TerminalSocket provides a bidirectional TCP socket to send and receive several types of data, each labelled with a
 * NUL-terminated string.
 *
 * This class is a base class (not instantiable from outside) for TerminalSocketServer and TerminalSocketClient (below).
 * Only one concurrent TCP connection is allowed (see TerminalSocketServer::startAccept() below).
 *
 * Boost asio is used for the low-level TCP socket. The main motivation is the requirement for asynchronous socket
 * operation. Sockets are slow. If instant processing results are to be sent, we don't want the socket operations take
 * too much time. In this module, four sending functions are async. They return immediately after accepting the data
 * to be sent. A separate thread (ioThread) is launched as this class instantiates, which processes the actual I/O
 * operations (io_context.run()). Received data is processed and sent back through four callback functions.
 *
 * The class accepted a running io_context from outside.
 *
 * Async operations need careful memory management. All the resource used should be alive when the operations are
 * actually performed and there should not be any memory leak after the operations are performed or cancelled.
 * shared_ptr's are frequently used in this class to help manage the memory.
 *
 * Cleaning up sockets also requires careful handling. Boost does well on cleaning up the socket. No manual shutdown or
 * close is performed on the socket objects in this class. Instead, we just carefully manage the life cycles of socket
 * instances and let their destructor do the clean-up. When a socket instance is destroyed, queued async work will
 * be aborted, which is handled in all async callback handlers.
 *
 * The thing we need to pay careful attention is the disconnection callback. Once the thread pool is created (by
 * creating a word_guard in ioThread), it seems that there is no easy way to call io_context.run() without making the
 * current thread become a worker thread (i.e. io_context.run() doesn't return). Therefore, we can't ask the
 * disconnection to be handled immediately. Considering starting a new connection and replacing the currently alive one,
 * the original callback must not be replaced by the new one before it's called, which is not easy to realize
 * if the callback is stored as a member variable. The current solution is: let async_recv carries the
 * callback function pointer. It is triggered when the socket disconnected (in handleRecv), or is passed to the next
 * async_recv (in handleRecv) when the next async receiving starts. If a socket is alive, there should be one
 * async_recv work in the queue that carries the function pointer. When the socket is disconnected, the callback is
 * triggered and there won't be any more async_recv. Therefore the callback will be triggered exactly once.
 * handleSend() do nothing with the callback but simply ignore the disconnection.
